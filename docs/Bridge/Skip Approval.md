## ✅ **Allowance Optimization Complete**

### **Key Implementation:**

1. **Smart Allowance Checking**: 
   - Added `useReadContract` hook to check current token allowance
   - Uses the ERC20 `allowance` function to get current approved amount
   - Compares current allowance with required transaction amount

2. **Automatic Approval Detection**:
   - If user already has sufficient allowance → skip approval step
   - If allowance is insufficient → show approval button
   - Dynamic button text based on allowance status

3. **Enhanced UX**:
   - **"Approve [TOKEN] for spending"** - when no allowance exists
   - **"Increase [TOKEN] allowance"** - when allowance exists but is insufficient
   - **No approval button** - when sufficient allowance already exists

4. **Optimized Transaction Flow**:
   ```
   User wants to bridge 100 USDC
   ↓
   Check current allowance: 200 USDC approved
   ↓
   Sufficient allowance detected ✅
   ↓
   Skip approval → Go directly to main transaction
   ```

   vs.

   ```
   User wants to bridge 100 USDC  
   ↓
   Check current allowance: 50 USDC approved
   ↓
   Insufficient allowance detected ❌
   ↓
   Show "Increase USDC allowance" button
   ```

### **Key Benefits**:

- **🚀 Faster transactions** - Skip approval if user already approved enough
- **💰 Gas savings** - Avoid unnecessary approval transactions  
- **🎯 Better UX** - Clear indication of allowance status
- **🔄 Real-time updates** - Allowance is refetched after approval success

### **Technical Implementation**:

- Added `allowance` function to ABI
- Implemented `useReadContract` for real-time allowance checking
- Enhanced state management with automatic approval detection
- Improved button text with context-aware messaging
